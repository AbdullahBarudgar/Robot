# Robot
To automate the different morning tasks which most of us perform before going to class in college.I create a Robot using Kotlin, which will perform these tasksfor us to simplify our lives.

# Kotlin Topics :

1. Variables and Operators
2. Functions
3. Arrays, Lists, and Strings
4. Conditionals and Loops
5. Exception Handling
6. Classes, Objects, and Interfaces.

# SPECIFICATIONS:

# Ring the alarm:

The Robot will ring the alarm every day at a specified time which will be set by you. I also set the days on which the alarm will not ring.
Make coffee:

# The Robot will make coffee for you every day.

1. How do you like your coffee (Black/With Milk).
2. How much sugar you’ll take.

The preferences according to the day of the week.

# Heat the water:

Temperature you like for your bathing water. Additional
information which can be added is whether you’ll be bathing on a particular day or not.

# Pack your bag:

The Robot will keep the books in your bag as per your timetable.The
timetable is input into Robot’s memory so that it works accordingly.

# Cook breakfast and lunch:

The Robot will cook your food according to your taste. You can let the Robot know which food
items do you like for breakfast and lunch and it will choose randomly from the list provided by
you. 

# Iron the clothes:

Tell the Robot what you want to wear before taking the bath and the clothes will be ready
for you as soon as you come out after bathing.
